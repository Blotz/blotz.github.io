#### What is a CTF

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises.
A flag is a string of text which looks like: `th1s_is_an_3xampl3_fl4g`
These flags are hidden around the website in the files.
Sometimes they are obscured to make it harder to find.

##### This is meant to be a fun challenge. please refrain from checking git logs

###### The "first" hash is on this page. (you can find them in any order tho)
