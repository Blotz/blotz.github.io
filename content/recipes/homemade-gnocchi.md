A Lovely [gnocchi recipe](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/villa-valentinas-potato-gnocchi) by [valentina harris](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/author/valentinaharris).
Works great for batch cooking gnocchi. I recommend creating the gnocchi on a day where you are free and freezing the extra dough as it is an intensive cook

This should take roughly 1 hour 20 mins depending on your cooking ability and if you have help.

## Equipment

- Something to turn the boiled potato into a fine paste. something like a potato ricer or mouli
- Large work area for preping dough
- Slotted spoon
- Large saucepan

## Ingredients

- 1kg floury potatoes (Marfona are best but you can use King Edward)
- 3 large eggs
- 300g plain flour

## Instructions

1.
    Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for for 10-15 mins.
    It should be soft enough to push a knife in but not to easy.
    If you have perticularly large potatoes, you can chop them up into smaller pieces to let them cook more evenly.

    If the potatoes are overcooked, they will be mushy and have absorbed too much water.

    Once done. peel the skins and store in bowl.

2.
    Press the potatoes though the potatoe ricer and into a bowl.
    Repeate this step again till the potatoes are nolonger lumpy.
    Transfer to a floured work surface.

3.
    Make a pit in your potato and crack the in your eggs.
    Begin to mix eggs and potato together while adding flour till it becomes easy to work with and the same lightness as pastry dough.

    Make sure to work with the dough quickly as the dough will become harder and bouncier the more you handle it.

    thee dough should be soft and hold together. it shouldnt feel sticky and be easily shaped.

4.
    Divide the dough into 3 equal pieces. wrap two of them in clingfilm and put them away for storage. (fridge or freezer)

5.
    Roll the dough into a cylinders on a lightly floured surface, again working lightly and quickly.
    As you roll you will also be gently stretching the dough. Keep the surface well floured as you donâ€™t want the dough to stick.

6.
    Chop the dough into a gnocchi lengthed chunks.
    Add an imprint using the back of a fork.

7.
    Bring the gnocchi to a large pot of boiling salted water.
    Drop them in a few at a time and let them cook for 2 mins.

    Once they float to the surface, bring them out with the slotted spoon.
