This is my own amazing rhubarb crumble recipe.
There are lots of little customisations that you can do to improve the taste.

You can serve your crumble with icecream or custard.
It is my favourite summer dish.

This will take 40-50 mins

## Equipment

- Mixing bowl
- Saucepan
- Oven proof dish to bake crumble in (should be large enough to fit a single layer of rhubarb in it)

## Ingredients

### Rhubarb

- 600g rhubarb (cut into chunks)
- 75ml Orange juice or Fresh Orange
- 50g caster sugar

### Crumble

- 100g cold butter
- 200g flour
- 50g caster sugar
- 50g brown sugar (optional. subsitute with 50g caster if unavailable)
- 20g walnuts (optional)
- 25g (a handfull) oats

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 180c/350f/gas 4

### Rhubarb

Put rhubarb, orange juice and zest, and sugar into the saucepan.
Simmer for 10 mins.
The Rhubarb should still be firm.
If lots of juice has formed, drain away untill it is stew-like and not soupy.

> This juice can be saved and mixed with vanilla ice cream for a lovely summer dish.

If you are using orange juice, check the packaging the sugar quantity and subtract that from the amount of caster sugar you are adding.
This will help balance the sweetness of the dish.

You can also add a splash of lemon juice for to add an extra zing to your dish.

### Crumble

Rub together butter and flour and oats together.
Be careful not to let the butter melt and only use fingertips.

Roughly chop walnuts on a chopping board.
If you don't have walnuts, you don't have to include them. you can also use hazelnuts if you prefer the taste of them.

Fold your sugars and walnuts together into your butter crumb mix.

### Baking

Place the rhubarb in the baking dish. top it with your crumble and bake for 30-40 mins or until topping is golden brown.
Serve with custard or ice cream.
