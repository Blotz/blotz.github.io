This is a really rough and quick write up mainly, so I can reference it in the future.
If someone else is reading this, Hi! feel free to message me and ask for more details.

It's the strudel I learned while working in Hochschoberhutte, Austria.
It would sell out each day making 76.80 euros.
Maybe I'll get round to adding pictures in the future!

## Ingredients

**Filling**

- Big bowl of apples
- Handful Raisins
- Rum
- 2 tbsp Sugar
- Vanilla Sugar
- Cinnamon

Really just add the flavors you like. I add like 1/2 tbsp Cinnamon

**Dough**

- 250g Butter
- 250g Quark (Topfen) or soft cheese
- 250g Flour
- 1 Egg
- Pinch Salt

Also 1/2 an egg for the egg wash.

## Prep

### Filling

The night before, Prep your filling.
Peal and chop your apples into smallish chunks.
Combine with the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl.
Then fill with water and leave to soak overnight.

### Dough

Put butter in your bowl and leave to warm up till the butter has softened.
When soft, add the rest of your ingredients and kneed together till the dough is smooth and nolonger grainy.
If the dough is sticky, add more flour.

The dough is finished when it feels like playdough.

Either leave the dough to rest in the fridge or move straight on to the next step.

## Bake

Prep your baking tray by brushing it with butter, then a dusting of flour.
Drain the liquid from your apple filling.

Cut the dough into 2.

Roll each ball out into a large rectangle (around 60x30cm).
Transfer the dough to your baking sheet.
Fill the middle column with 1/2 the filling before folding the strudel into a long tube.
If you have enough dough at the edges, fold up the ends to seal the strudel.

Repeat with the other dough ball.

Once ready, apply an egg wash and bake at 180c till its golden brown (or smells really good)
