      <description>WannaCry is the largest ransomware attack. The attack started at 07:44 UTC on 12 May 2017 and was halted a few hours later at 15:03 UTC. In that time, it had spread to over 230,000 computers in 150 different countries. Companies/Agencies such as the NHS and Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK where massively crippled in this attack as they had tens of thousands of devices infected.
The widespread chaos caused by WannaCry was only possible due to a computer exploit, known as Eternal Blue, which had leaked onto the clear web a month ago.</description>

      <description>Random numbers are a core part of cryptography.
They are used in encryption due to the fact that it is much harder to guess a randomly generated password than it is to guess any other kind of password. This core concept has resulted in random number generation/generators becoming an integral part of cryptography.
This would be fine if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the fact that computers suck at being random. Computers work with exactness and precision.</description>

      <description>Everywhere online, i have heard that wifi was insecure.
Posts talking about WEP and WPA being insecure. WPA-2 being better but still flawed. I have decided to try and hack my own wifi router to see whether it really is insecure
Setup I am using the tp-link archer VR600 v2 as my router with WPA-2 wifi encryption. I&amp;rsquo;ll be executing my attack from my Arch Linux Laptop
Hacking my own wifi After looking around online, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered the hashcat cracking wpawpa2 wiki article and I&amp;rsquo;ll be following along as a guide.</description>
