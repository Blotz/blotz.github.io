The attack started at 07:44 UTC on 12 May 2017 and was halted a few hours later at 15:03 UTC. In that time, it had spread to over 230,000 computers in 150 different countries. Companies/Agencies such as the NHS and Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK where massively crippled in this attack as they had tens of thousands of devices infected.
The widespread chaos caused by WannaCry was only possible due to a computer exploit, known as Eternal Blue, which had leaked onto the clear web a month ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
